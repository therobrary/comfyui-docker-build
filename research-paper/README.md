## Abstract

This research paper examines the taximeter effect in the context of developer AI tool usage, comparing behavioral patterns between limited credit/request-based pricing models and unlimited subscription plans. The study analyzes developer productivity, innovation patterns, and decision-making processes across different pricing structures.

## Research Questions

1. How does metered pricing affect the frequency and quality of AI tool usage by developers?
2. What behavioral patterns emerge when developers switch between limited and unlimited plans?
3. How does the taximeter effect impact innovation and experimentation with AI tools?

## Methodology

The research employs a multi-disciplinary approach combining behavioral economics, software engineering productivity studies, and comparative analysis across industries including cloud computing, utilities, and transportation services.
